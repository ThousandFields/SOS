Designed to be the ultimate companion for both vanilla and heavily modded campaigns (like Neurotrauma or BaroCraftables), it provides a seamless, integrated interface to explore the complex economy of Europa.

## Project Status: Beta

**S.O.S.** is currently in its Beta stage. While the core functionality is stable and high-performing, we are working towards deep integration with the game's mechanics and immersion.

### Late Mod Roadmap: The Neural Link System

In future updates, access to the S.O.S. interface will be gated behind a **Chip Progression System**. Players will need to craft and consume specialized neural chips to unlock different modules of the database.

#### Tiered Modules

- **Fabricator Chip (Lv. 1):** Unlocks the ability to view crafting recipes (Compatible with vanilla and modded stations).
- **Fabricator Chip (Lv. 2):** Unlocks "Reverse Lookup" (View what items can be crafted using the selected material).
- **Deconstructor Chip (Lv. 1):** Unlocks deconstruction yield data.
- **Deconstructor Chip (Lv. 2):** Unlocks "Reverse Deconstruction" (View which items provide this material when recycled).
- **Medical Chip (Lv. 1 & 2):** Specialized modules for medical recipes and advanced chemistry.

> Note: This proposal is merely an idea at the moment; there is no guarantee that it will be implemented in this specific manner in the future—it could take a different, more convenient form.

*Stay tuned for these updates as we move toward the 1.0 Full Release.*

## Common questions

**Q:** *Can it be used on vanilla servers?*

- **A:** Absolutely. The most it will require from the server is new items, nothing more.

**Q:** *Is this a client-only mod, or does it need to be included on the server?*

- **A:** Currently, it's entirely client-only. We plan for it to always be client-only, so you can use it even on a completely vanilla server without mods. If the server doesn't have it, then the full system unlocked in the beta version will be used.

**Q:** *Is it really compatible with ALL in-game items?*

- **A:** *Yes! Absolutely everything, including submarine parts that are impossible to obtain. I've decided not to exclude these items for now for descriptions and another useful metadata. If they bother you, you can create an issue in the Git project, leave a comment on itch.io, or contact me directly, and I'll prioritize it.*
